Hi,

This is a sample project where in I am using Frank automation framework for a native iOS app.

The native iOS app I am using is the one which is provided as a test app  by Pete Hodgson for Frank.

This project would mostly tell you how to author the acceptance tests for the native iOS app.

The way Project is structured is :
   1) Project has Employee Admin application
   2) There is a Frank folder which contains "features" directory which hosts my_first.feature, this is the file where in we are writing the tests. 


Please email me for any issues you face while trying to understand this. I actively maintain my own website on test automation and testing techniques. Feel free to refer those posts.
